## 0.4.1 (2025-03-25)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Popover Animation**: Refactored `ColorPickerPopover` to use CSS-driven `data-status` transitions, eliminating flicker at (0,0) and adding smooth exit animation.
- 🐛 **Lint**: Fixed `Pointer` component missing `default` prop; replaced `@ts-ignore` with `@ts-expect-error` in `Eyedropper`.

### ⚡ Performance

- ⚡ **Bundle Size**: Reduced core bundle from ~15.5KB to ~7.2KB gzip by removing inline style computation in favor of CSS class-driven animation.

### 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Added 4 new animation status tests for `ColorPickerPopover` (94 total).

## 0.4.0 (2025-03-25)

### 🚀 Major Improvements

- ✨ **Popover Mode**: Added `ColorPickerPopover`, a built-in compact floating picker using `@floating-ui`.
- 🧩 **Ecosystem Plugins**: Native integration for **Tailwind CSS**, **UnoCSS**, and **Nuxt 3**.
- 🌓 **Dark Mode**: Premium dark theme support across all components.
- ♿ **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Full ARIA support, screen reader compatibility, and refined contrast.

### 🏠 Infrastructure

- 🏗️ **Package Architecture**: Fixed critical `package.json` export paths (`main`, `module`, `require`) for full CJS/ESM compatibility.
- 📦 **Optimized Bundling**: Externalized `@floating-ui/vue`, reducing the core bundle size by **~50%**.
- 🔌 **Nuxt Module**: Fixed CSS resolution and added `ColorPickerPopover` to auto-imports.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Interaction**: Fixed vertical direction inversion in `Hue`/`Alpha`. Added `pointercancel` support and a right-click guard.
- 🐛 **Reactivity**: Fixed `useColorState` empty string sync and prevented double-emission in `ColorInput`.
- 🐛 **UI/UX**: Encoded SVG data URLs, added `prefers-reduced-motion`, and ensured global `border-box` layout.
